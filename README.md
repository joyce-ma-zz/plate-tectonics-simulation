# plate-tectonics-simulation
My program portrays the interactions between tectonic plates using cellular automata animations. More specifically, it models a sped up version of three kinds of plate boundaries -- two converging continental plates, two diverging oceanic plates, and the convergence of a continental and oceanic plate.
